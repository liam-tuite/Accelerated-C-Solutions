Most of these solutions don't presume extra knowledge of the reader from outside the book. I've made an effort to construct solutions using only the knowledge and tools given in the preceding text, as I believe these are the kind of solutions the authors of the book were more concerned with. It is also more helpful for someone who is stuck on a solution to see the approach they were supposed to take without using a function or keyword that is several chapters ahead in the book. However, in some cases I didn't find a possible solution that didn't require some external learning (for example, exercise 4-4 uses std::fixed which was not mentioned in the book). 

Also worth noting is that these solutions were written within Microsoft Visual Studio, which means I could avail of the "pragma once" directive, which may not work in some C++ development environments.

In some of the later chapters in the books, the exercises flow together in such a way that completing one exercise on its own doesn't leave much to show without the following exercises also being complete. For example, in chapter 10, exercises 10-4 and 10-5 aren't very valuable without exercise 10-6, so in cases like these I have just provided a solution for the final exercise (in this case 10-6) which also encompasses the previous exercises.

I have completed the solutions to chapters 0 through 11, with the following exceptions:
3-1
5-4
5-8
11-9

Some chapters have theory-based questions without code. For each of these chapters I have included a file named "Theory.txt" in its directory with my answers to these questions.

Some chapters feature solutions that require the user input a bunch of data, such as student records. I have included the sample data inputs for these programs in the "data" folder. "grades.txt" and "grammar_input.txt" were gotten from here: https://github.com/bitsai/book-exercises/tree/master/Accelerated%20C%2B%2B/data
