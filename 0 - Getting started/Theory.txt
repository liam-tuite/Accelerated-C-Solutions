0.1:
When this statement is executed, the implementation evaluates the expression "3 + 4", yielding 7 as its result, but upon reaching the semi-colon this result is discarded.

0.5:
This program is invalid because the body of a function must be enclosed in braces, even if it is only a single statement.

0.6:
This program is valid (there are as many left-braces as right-braces)

0.7:
This program is invalid. When the compiler reaches the "*/", the preceding comment is ended. Immediately following this is "as its starting and ending delimiters */", which will cause the compiler to produce an error.

0.8:
This program is valid. When the compiler reaches the "*/", the rest of the line is still a comment as there is a preceding "//".
