4-1:
This code does not work as s.name.size() is of type string::size_type (which is size_t) and maxlen is of type int. To use max with both values as arguments, we could either cast s.name.size() to int, or cast maxlen to string::size_type, like so:
max((int) s.name.size(), maxlen);
or
max(s.name.size(), (string::size_type) maxlen);

f() must return a container (which supports the subscript/index operator) that contains values of a numeric data type.
